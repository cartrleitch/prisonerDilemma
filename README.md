pDilemmaMain contains the functions for playing this version of the prisoner dilemma game. pDilemmaStrats is where you define functions for strategies to play the game. If you import both modules, you need to pass an array called "strategyList" to playAllStrategies to play all strategies against each other. Finally, playAllStrategiesMultiple plays all strategies against each other a specified number of times (default is 50).
